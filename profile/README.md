# 🎓💀 Pillai College: Where Dreams Go to Die and Nightmares Come to Code

Welcome to the digital hellscape of Pillai College, where we're about to unleash a series of projects so cursed, they might just open a portal to the underworld. Or at least make our IT department consider a career change. Again.

## 🚀🔥 Mission Statement

To create software so haunted, it makes the Exorcist look like a comedy. We're not just pushing the envelope; we're setting it on fire and mailing the ashes to your future self.

## 🔮🧟 Upcoming Projects (a.k.a. Digital Doomsday Devices)

### 1. "Pillaites" - The Social Media Platform 📱☠️

Because what the world needs is another place for students to watch their social lives disintegrate in real-time. Features include:

- "Panic Button": Instantly changes your screen to a lecture video when your crush walks by. Goodbye, dignity!
- "Exam Countdown Timer": Watch in horror as your future crumbles before your eyes
- "Grade Predictor": Now with 99.9% more accuracy in crushing your spirits
- "Parent Detector": Automatically hides all evidence of your college "extracurriculars"

### 2. "GradeLate" - The Learning Management System 📚🕳️

Where your assignments go to decompose and your academic aspirations are buried in an unmarked grave.

- "Deadline Roulette": Randomly changes due dates because who needs sleep anyway?
- "Plagiarism Roulette": For when you're feeling lucky and ethically flexible

### 3. "CaffeineOverflow" - The Coffee Ordering App ☕️😵

Because nothing says "higher education" like hallucinating from sleep deprivation at 4 AM.

- "Insomnia Mode": Automatically doubles your caffeine intake during finals week
- "Cardiac Alert": Notifies your emergency contact when your heart rate matches hummingbird wings

### 4. "DegreesOfRegret" - The Major Selector 🎲🔍

Flip a coin for your future! Now with a built-in existential crisis generator.

## 📜⚰️ License

This project is licensed under the "Abandon All Hope" License. Use at your own peril. Side effects may include existential dread, spontaneous coding in your sleep, and the irresistible urge to major in underwater basket weaving.

## 🎭🌚 Disclaimer

Any resemblance to functional software, living or dead, is purely accidental and frankly, a bit concerning. No developers were harmed in the making of this repository. Physically, at least. Emotionally, we make no promises.

Remember: At Pillai College, we don't just corrupt code. We corrupt souls. Happy debugging, and may the odds be ever in your favor! 💻👻🔥
